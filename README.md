## Prerequisites

Before you run the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number-sorter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd number-sorter
   ```

3. Run the `sort_and_save_numbers.py` script to execute the sorting and saving operations.

## Usage

The script performs the following operations:

1. It defines two lists of integers, `numbers1` and `numbers2`, and combines them into a third list called `all_numbers`.

2. It sorts `numbers1` and `numbers2` in ascending order.

3. It saves the sorted `numbers1` to a text file named `numbers1.txt`, with each number on a separate line.

4. It saves the sorted `numbers2` to a text file named `numbers2.txt`, with each number on a separate line.

5. It sorts `all_numbers` (the combination of `numbers1` and `numbers2`) in ascending order.

6. It saves the sorted `all_numbers` to a text file named `all_numbers.txt`, with each number on a separate line.
